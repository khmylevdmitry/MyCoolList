#  Food ordering system
Imagine you have to design an application for a restaurantordering system. Please follow the requirements listed below: 

### Functional requirements:

<li> It’s possible to order lunch and/or drink. </li>
<li>Lunch consists of a main course and dessert. </li>
<li>Each meal and drink must have a name and price. </li>
<li>There are three cuisines available to choose from(Polish, Mexican, Italian).</li> 
<li>When ordering a drink, the customer can additionallyask for ice cubes or/and lemon.</li>


### Non-functional requirements: 

<li>  It has to work “out of the box” without any additionalrequirements. We should be able to run it and place an order. </li>
<li>  Interactive command-line interface (no GUI). </li>
<li>  The solution you come up with should be extendable(it should be possible to add new cuisines/dishes in the future). </li>
